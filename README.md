# NA-KD Slider Tutorial
The slider items for *Month Of Newness* are generated by JavaScript, which fetches the items from an external file called `slider-data.js`. This means no HTML should be used when appending items to the slider, and neither should any HTML-block be scheduled or published in EpiServer. Also, the weekdays and the *Today*-label gets updated automatically by specifying a day in the external data file.

### 1. Get data-file
Before appending an item to the slider, you must make sure that you have the latest version of `slider-data.js` (referred to as data-file). If you don't have the latest version on your computer, download it from EpiServer by going to *Media* in the left sidebar, then *Startfeed > 2018 > Augusti*. This is also where you should upload your updated data-file.

### 2. Structure of data-file
The structure of the data-file is pretty simple and straight forward. On the top of the file, there is a comment that says `// Slider Items starts here` and at the bottom at the file there's a comment that says `// Slider Items ends here`. You can only edit between these comments. Between these comments, there are different sections that starts with `{` and ends with `}`. These sections are refered to as objects. On object correspond to one slider item.

### 3. Append an item to slider
To append an item to the slider, go to the bottom of the file. Below the last object, add another one by pasting the following code: 
```
{
    title: "[TITLE HERE]",
    cta: "Express yourself",
    day: 4,
    dayAffix: 'th',
    image: "https://www.na-kd.com/siteassets/startfeed/2018/augusti/08-02/img-4.jpg?ref=2B300E8782",
    mobile: "https://www.na-kd.com/siteassets/startfeed/2018/augusti/08-02/img-4-mobile.jpg?ref=2B300E8782",
    banner: "assets/IMG-banner-6.jpg",
    url: "https://www.na-kd.com/en/campaigns/graphic-collection"
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure that the second-last object ends with a comma after the curly brace (`},`). Elsewise, the slider will disappear. The last object (the one you just added) should not end with a comma though.
An example of this practice: `{object}, {object}, {object}`. This means that you must always add a comma on the second-last item when you add a new item.
